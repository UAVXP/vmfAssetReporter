vmfAssetReporter
================

Reads in a .vmf file and spits out a list of the assets. Written in visual C# 2010 Express

1. Run the vmfAssetReporter.exe

2. Select your output at the bottom

3. Open the vmf

4. Click save if you want to save the list as a .txt

5. If you want another output select it at the bottom and reopen the vmf (yes I know that's a dumb process)
